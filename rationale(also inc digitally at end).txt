The company’s name “Maze Industries” lead to the decision of making the company
a company based around solving difficuilt problems. Therefore, I decided to make the 
company a company that helps people to make their difficuilt business ideas into a 
reality by guiding them.

Since the logo of the company is mainly text and line orientated, I have decided to use 
type and basic minimalistic line drawings to tell the bussiness’s story. The user should 
feel part of the story while interacting. They should feel as though they themselves are 
struggling to get through the scenario. Therefore, I have made the story into a sort of a 
game/puzzle/maze the user needs to get through.

At the start the text and each scene moves relatively slowly, and the user moves slowly 
through the scenario. However as soon as the “guide” appears , text and animations start 
moving and appearing slightly faster (as things move when one has found a solution to
 one’s problem).

Signs of life are present by making objects throb or move repeatedly. I used similiar 
animations for these signs of life in each scene to make the user used to the format 
and help them realize where to click or move to next. Hierarchy is created by guiding 
the users eye to where there is a moving object on the page. Emphasis is also created 
for each object by looping movements.
